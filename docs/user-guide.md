# PimpMyStremio User Guide

After running the application, it would normally update to the latest release. After this is done, you will be presented with a page in your browser.

You will see a [list of categories](https://pms-images.now.sh/category-list.png).

Click any of the categories to see the add-ons it holds.

After choosing an add-on you want, you must first click the [download button](https://pms-images.now.sh/download-button.png).

After the add-on has downloaded, click the [play button](https://pms-images.now.sh/play-button.png) to load the add-on.

It is worth mentioning that some add-ons will open their settings menu after you press the [play button](https://pms-images.now.sh/play-button.png), this is because those add-ons require additional user settings in order to work. If you do not know what settings to choose just press cancel or uninstall that add-on.

Choose more add-ons you want and download, then play each one.

After you are done choosing and running all the add-ons you want, scroll to the top of the page and press the [external button](https://pms-images.now.sh/external-button.png).

After pressing the [external button](https://pms-images.now.sh/external-button.png) you will be [presented with a menu](https://pms-images.now.sh/choose-stremio.png) where you will need to choose between Stremio App or Stremio Web.

More streams will work in the Stremio App, so this is the recommended choice, but there are many add-ons that will work with just Stremio Web too.

Simply press "Load in Stremio App" (the recommended choice, requires [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) installed), and this will load all your PimpMyStremio add-ons in Stremio.

You should be aware that PimpMyStremio add-ons only work while PimpMyStremio is running, it is for this reason why it is recommended to set PimpMyStremio to run on start-up, you can do so by pressing the [settings button](https://pms-images.now.sh/settings-button.png) (located to the top right of the PimpMyStremio page) and enabling the "Run on start-up" setting.

There are many other fun features that are not presented here, this guide is meant as a quick start guide for new users.
